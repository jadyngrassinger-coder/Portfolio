      <h3>The State of Technology: Governments in the New Era of Technology </h3>
      <p>The article explores how the digital revolution, believed to empower democracy by spreading information and weakening authoritarian control, has instead produced mixed results. While social media helped movements like the Arab Spring, it has also fueled misinformation, polarization, and new tools for surveillance and censorship that strengthen dictatorships. As technology advances, the balance of power may shift further toward authoritarianism capable of exploiting data and digital control, leaving democracies struggling to protect freedoms without stopping innovation. </p>
