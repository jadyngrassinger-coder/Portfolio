          <h2 id="Summary">Skyrim Summary</h2>
          <p>Skyrim is a 2011 Bethesda game known for it's open-world-role-playing game. The game starts with you a prisoner in the midst of a war between the Imperials and the Stormcloaks. After escaping with nothing but your life you head towards the nearest city. You soon realize that you are the prophesied hero, the Dragonborn, that will save the world from doom. Along with this main storyline there are 100s of side quests to be completed from becoming a vampire or werewolf to becoming an Imperial.</p>

              <p>Gameplay involves a large open world to explore with a strong focus on combat. Combat in the game includes magic, melee, and stealth. Unlike most combat orientated games, Skyrim offers a classless system for more relaxed gameplay and skill-based leveling. You can choose from a diverse type of races and character builds to design a unique character. My personal favorite mechanic of the game includes fast travel. Instead of having to travel from one location physically and painstakingly to the next, you can just select on the map where you would like to go.</p>

            <p>Before Skyrim the world of Tamriel was created by powerful gods called the Aedra. Over the years many races rose and fell, Elves, Men, Khajit, and others. The human race known as the Nords came to Skyrim from a land called Atmora, led by the Ysgramor, who fought ancient wars against the native Snow Elves and built the first Nordic kingdoms. Centuries later, the Septim Empire united most of Tamriel under one rule, but by Skyrim’s time, that empire was weak. Old gods, dragons, and ancient prophecies begin to stir again do to the newfound Dragonborn, YOU! </p>
